There was a startup once... But they decided not to respond, thus, now I have a website in my portfolio.

Apart from a website itself, this project also consists of:
1. A parser to get heritages from wiki (at least for now) with important info and images.
2. A telegram bot to be able to moderate the parsed heritages.
3. Two database tables - one for the pre-moderated heritages and one - for the saved ones.
4. Some minor manual changes, such as a "PARSE" button in admin interface.
5. All this runs together using docker (a pain in the ass).
